Anime Vanguard Macro

Automation macro for the Anime Vanguard game software

⚙️ Overview

This macro automates repetitive tasks in the game “Anime Vanguard” (or whichever software you’re targeting).
It is built using AutoHotkey scripts, and helps you speed up routine operations so you can focus on strategy rather than manual clicks.

📂 Repository Contents

Salmon_AV.exe – The compiled executable version of the macro.

update.ahk – The AutoHotkey source script (you can open or modify this if you want to customize the behaviour).

Data/ – A folder containing supporting data (e.g., image assets, config files).

.gitignore – Standard Git ignore file for excluding compiled binaries, temporary files, etc.

🛠 Installation & Setup

Download/Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/tutututu2222/Anime_Vanguard-Macro-2.git
cd Anime_Vanguard-Macro-2


Ensure you have AutoHotkey installed (if you plan to run the .ahk script).

Get AutoHotkey from https://www.autohotkey.com

If you’re using the compiled .exe, you can simply run Salmon_AV.exe.

If you want to tweak behaviour, open update.ahk in an editor, make your changes, then run via AutoHotkey.

Configure any settings as needed (for example resolution, window position, delay times, etc).

If there is a config file in the Data/ folder, edit that accordingly.

Launch the game, then launch the macro while the game window is active.

Make sure the game window is in the expected position / resolution so the macro’s image detection or coordinates line up.

🎮 Usage Guide

Run the macro (Salmon_AV.exe or via update.ahk).

The macro will automatically perform defined tasks (e.g., click loops, navigation, etc).

Monitor the macro to confirm it’s interacting correctly.

If behaviour seems off (e.g., window moved, UI changed, new game version), stop the macro and update the image assets or coordinates.

You can adjust delays and iterations inside update.ahk to suit your machine’s speed or the game’s responsiveness.

🔧 Configuration & Customization

Open update.ahk in a text editor to customize settings such as:

Delay times between actions

Number of loops/cycles

Screen/window resolution and position offsets

Image/matching thresholds (if using image recognition)

If you add or modify image assets (in Data/), ensure they’re referenced correctly in the script.

If the game UI updates and breaks the macro, you may need to re-capture relevant UI elements and update the script accordingly.
