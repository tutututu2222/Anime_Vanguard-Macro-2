# Anime Vanguard Macro
_Automation macro for the Anime Vanguard game software_

## ⚙️ Overview
This macro automates repetitive tasks in the game **Anime Vanguard**.  
It’s built using **AutoHotkey** and helps you speed up routine operations so you can focus on strategy rather than manual clicking.

## 📂 Repository Contents
- `Salmon_AV.exe` – The compiled executable version of the macro  
- `update.ahk` – The AutoHotkey source script (customizable)  
- `Data/` – Folder containing supporting data (e.g., image assets, config files)  
- `.gitignore` – Standard Git ignore file for excluding binaries and temp files  

## 🛠 Installation & Setup
1. **Clone or download** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tutututu2222/Anime_Vanguard-Macro-2.git
   cd Anime_Vanguard-Macro-2
   ```
2. **Install AutoHotkey** (if you plan to use the `.ahk` file)  
   👉 [https://www.autohotkey.com](https://www.autohotkey.com)
3. Run `Salmon_AV.exe` directly **or** open `update.ahk` in AutoHotkey.
4. Configure any required settings (resolution, delay times, etc.).  
   - Edit the config file or variables inside `update.ahk` if needed.  
5. **Start the game**, then **launch the macro** while the game window is active.

> 💡 Make sure the game window is positioned correctly and resolution matches what the macro expects.

## 🎮 Usage Guide
- Run the macro (`Salmon_AV.exe` or via `update.ahk`).
- It will automatically perform the defined actions (clicks, loops, etc.).
- Watch it once to ensure it interacts with the game properly.
- If the UI changes, update the coordinates or image assets.
- Adjust delays and timing in `update.ahk` for better performance.

## 🔧 Configuration & Customization
You can modify:
- Action delay times  
- Number of cycles or loops  
- Screen/window position offsets  
- Image recognition thresholds  

All editable in `update.ahk`.

If the game UI changes:
- Recapture affected UI images
